# Academic Sources Summary - NeuroGenServer

## üìö Total Academic Sources: 3

### 1. ‚úÖ **ArXiv** - FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- **Status**: Fully implemented with web scraping
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Search for papers in Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science
  - Direct PDF download URLs
  - Real search results from arxiv.org
- **Implementation**: Uses web scraper to fetch results from ArXiv search pages
- **Example PDF URLs**: `https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23765.pdf`

### 2. ‚ùå **Semantic Scholar** - PLACEHOLDER ONLY
- **Status**: Not implemented (returns empty array)
- **Code Location**: `/workspace/modules/blueprints/features/academic_search.py` line 134-137
- **Current Implementation**:
```python
elif source == "semantic":
    # Implement Semantic Scholar search
    # This would be similar to arXiv but with Semantic Scholar URLs
    return []
```
- **Note**: The `academic_api.py` module has a placeholder function but it's not connected to the blueprint

### 3. ‚ùå **OpenAlex** - PLACEHOLDER ONLY  
- **Status**: Not implemented (returns empty array)
- **Code Location**: `/workspace/modules/blueprints/features/academic_search.py` line 139-142
- **Current Implementation**:
```python
elif source == "openalex":
    # Implement OpenAlex search
    # This would use OpenAlex specific APIs or web scraping
    return []
```
- **Note**: The `academic_api.py` module has a mock function that returns fake data but it's not connected

## üéØ Summary

**Question**: "What other Academic sources can we download from? There should be 3 total"

**Answer**: 
- **Total Sources Defined**: 3 (ArXiv, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex)
- **Fully Functional**: 1 (ArXiv only)
- **Placeholders**: 2 (Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex)

Only **ArXiv** is actually functional for downloading academic papers. The other two sources (Semantic Scholar and OpenAlex) exist in the code but are not implemented - they just return empty results.

## üìä Test Results
When testing all three sources:
- ArXiv: ‚úÖ Returns real results with PDF URLs
- Semantic Scholar: ‚ùå Returns 0 results (empty implementation)
- OpenAlex: ‚ùå Returns 0 results (empty implementation)

## üîß Implementation Status
The infrastructure supports all 3 sources:
- The API endpoints accept all 3 source parameters
- The multi-source search feature works (but only returns ArXiv results)
- The frontend likely has UI for all 3 sources

But only ArXiv has actual search and download functionality implemented.
