By creating this project, it will give students\nthe opportunity to gain experience with block chain, and hopefully be a starting place for narrowing\nthat ever growing gap. After much research, it is likely that this proposed application is the first of\nits kind that utilizes NFTs to teach mathematical concepts. Aside from user benefit of this application, there is also an intellectual merit in the block chain\nand education fields. Best described by Carmen Holotescu, \"As education becomes more open,\ndiversified, democratised, and decentralised, the block chain technology is taken in consideration\nby researchers, teachers and institutions, to maintain reputation, trust in certification, and proof of\nlearning\" [17]. Further, development of this project continues research on NFT and block chain\ntechnologies. This application can also serve as the boilerplate basis for other NFT-based educational\ntools and resources.

Elmessiry et al. has looked at designing an incentive mechanism that can be used by\nteachers and students to achieve better learning outcomes in an effective and cost-efficient manner\n1A teacher at Pepperdine University using NFTs to award course completion certifications to students: https://upcea.edu/tech-\ntrends-in-higher-ed-metaverse-nft-and-dao/"

Because MetaMask is easily integrated into Moralis, and thus NFTrig, there\nis little a user needs to do to create a connection aside from installing the MetaMask extension, and\nclicking connect.\n4.1.4\nFront End Design. Front end design was accomplished primarily through Visual Studio. The\nLive Server extension was installed which allows each developer to \"host\" their developed website\nusing a native web application.

This style of architecture is required for this project because the smart contracts must be\nstored on the server-side chain in order to be functional. The use of proxy contracts also allows our\nsmart contracts to be fully upgradeable with any future updates that may need to be implemented.\n5.2\nChoice of Programming Language\nThis section examines and explains the benefit of each chosen language employed in NFTrig.

Solidity is \"similar to JavaScript and yet has some features of object-oriented languages\nsuch as Java and C++\" [26]. This is a leading language for the development of smart contracts and\nuse on block chain technologies. This project utilizes the solidity library openzeppelin in order to\ncreate a solid foundation for the smart contracts. Hardhat and Node JS are then used for the testing\nand deployment of the smart contracts to the Polygon blockchain.\n5.2.2\nJavaScript. In the NFTrig application, JavaScript (JS) is primarily used in the front end\napplication. The primary purpose of this language is generally to create dynamic and interactive\nweb content [15]. For the client, JS was used in the navigation bar to allow for clickable links and\nresizing of the navigation bar in smaller screens. This language was also used to give buttons\nfunctionality ranging from logging in to MetaMask to purchasing NFTrig cards. Further, JS was used\nto test the logic of the front-end combination page until the smart contract was applied. Aside from\naugmenting HTML and CSS application pages, JavaScript is also used in this project to connect the\nback end smart contract with the from end web application. This application was also developed\nusing Next JS and deployed via an application known as vercel.\n5.2.3\nHTML and CSS. Web development of the user interface was primarily completed using\nHTML and CSS (Bootstrap5). These languages are equally popular and necessary to develop the\nweb pages [13]. Instead of creating all CSS requirements from scratch, Bootstrap5 was utilized to\nallow for cleaner design across web pages and better alignment of web page elements. Bootstrap5\nalso simplifies the need to explicitly code buttons and other interactive items.\n5.3\nSecurity Considerations\nThroughout this project, there have been several security considerations discovered that threatened\nthe safety and use of the application. One such discovered issue was initially, there was no code\nwritten to block a user from looking at another users token. Further, before minting a new NFT\ncard, the smart contracts check to ensure that the card does not already exist, the cards used for\ncombining are owned by the user, and that the newly minted card follows the correct probabilities\nof outcomes shows in 2. These probabilities are coded into the smart contract.\n5.4\nSmart Contract Design\nThe smart contract for this project is broken up into two separate contracts. The first of which is\nthe NFTrig logic contract which contains the logic for purchasing packs of cards as well as the logic\nfor how cards will interact with each other. The second contract is the marketplace contract which\nwill allow users to trade their own NFTs with other users through the website. Within the NFTrig",

Further, before minting a new NFT\ncard, the smart contracts check to ensure that the card does not already exist, the cards used for\ncombining are owned by the user, and that the newly minted card follows the correct probabilities\nof outcomes shows in 2. These probabilities are coded into the smart contract.\n5.4\nSmart Contract Design\nThe smart contract for this project is broken up into two separate contracts. The first of which is\nthe NFTrig logic contract which contains the logic for purchasing packs of cards as well as the logic\nfor how cards will interact with each other. The second contract is the marketplace contract which\nwill allow users to trade their own NFTs with other users through the website. Within the NFTrig"

The marketplace\ncontract contains information about sale history as well as the functionality to post new sales and\npurchase items for sale. Both of these contracts were deployed as upgradeable contracts so they\ncan have updates implemented in the future.\n5.5\nNFT Storage and Naming Conventions\nAll NFT images are stored on the server with the HTML, CSS, and JS files. The naming convention\nfor each image references what image it is in four numbers. The first number is the power of sin, the\nsecond is the power of cos, the third is the rarity or color of the card (0-3 is green, blue, purple, and\nred respectively), and the final number is the text variant (0-3). These files were named accordingly\nto better determine the output if cards were combined using a mathematical function. For example,\na sin card might have the naming convention: 1023.jpg. 10 defines it is a sin card, 2 defines it is\nrarity purple, and 3 defines it is text variant 3. The purpose of naming the files in this way is so\nthat the front end can easily determine which image corresponds to a particular NFT by simply\nlooking at the four features of each token which match the four numbers in the file name.\n5.6\nClient Design\nThe NFTrig application interface was designed using HTML and CSS. The primary use of CSS was\noften replaced by Bootstrap5. Bootstrap 5, a library for CSS, allows for easier scaling and alignment\nof objects in the HTML file, and thus the computer screen [23]. Documentation on the Bootstrap5\nhas utilized to a full extent. Each section examines the layout and use of each application page.\n5.6.1\nNFTrig Home. The interface is designed to allow a user to access the marketplace, their\nindividual current collections, and their profile. The navigational bar contains links to the client-side\nfacing pages: NFTrigHome, MyCards, CombineCards, Marketplace, and Game. We used a total of\nthree colors to enable good contrast and make it easier for our users to view complex graphs and\nformula without a cluttered background 2. The JavaScript elements declared are reusable across\nmultiple screens. They support functions and interactions such as a user hovering over a cell or\nclicking a cell and providing both feedback and error handling to the user. The navigation bar is\nalso, the top bar changes color to indicate the tab that the user is on.\n5.6.2\nCombination. The main purpose of the combination page is for users to choose cards that\nthey currently own, and see options for combining them using either multiplication or division.\nFigure 1 displays the layout of the screen where user selected cards are shown on the left, and\npotential results are shown on the right.\nThe page utilizes Bootstrap5 capabilities to format effectively to different screen sizes and\nresolutions. It connects with a back end script to the smart contract. This provides functionality to\nthe buttons and easy generation of possible NFT results. Below shows the probabilities of generated\nNFT outcomes based on the selected input cards.\n5.6.3\nMarketplace and MyCards. Marketplace and MyCards are similar pages, as they connect to\na data source and display NFTs. The Marketplace tab shows all NFT cards available for purchase\nboth from other users who own NFTs and cards owned by the NFTrig project. MyCards however\nspecifically shows all cards owned by a user. The layout for each generates all necessary NFT\nimages and information about the rarity.

From front end web development to back end smart contract creation and\nNFT storage, this section describes the requirements and software used to complete the project. 4.1.1\nCompiling IDE. The smart contracts created for NFTrig are hosted on Remix. Remix is an\nan open source online compiler IDE that can be used to test and deploy smart contracts [1]. The\nNFTrig: Using Blockchain Technologies for Math Education\n5\nplatform can be accessed by any browser, and it allows the developer to write and deploy smart\ncontracts on an actual or test server simultaneously. The current deployment is on a test server. In\norder to test and debug the smart contract, Visual Studio Code is used. Visual Studio was found\nto be the best code editor because a developer can easily upload most file types, and edit them\n[19]. For NFTrig, it was used to develop front end HTML and CSS files, as well as back end solidity\ncontract editing. The required installed plugins for Visual Studio (VS) include Solidity and Block\nchain development. [21] These allowed for simple, straightforward development of code. 4.1.2\nMoralis. Moralis SDK is the primary back end platform for the project. The platform allows\nconnection of the front end web application to the smart contract. [8] The Moralis platform uses\na combination of server management and a JavaScript SDK to allow for maximum interaction\nand simplicity. A developer can do many tasks through this including authentication of users,\ngetting necessary user data, and connecting with MetaMask in a non-complicated and simply coded\nprocess. The only expectation is that a developer will need to have programming knowledge in\nJavaScript as well as a familiarity with Moralis and MetaMask, experience querying a database, and\nsome knowledge of Web3 development to ensure maximum results and efficiency. Moralis also has\nthe ability to easily connect to MetaMask. 4.1.3\nMetaMask. MetaMask is the digital wallet required for participation in the NFTrig game\napplication. It allows the collection of purchases from the user, and it can be installed as an extension\non a browser for increased ease of use [28]. MetaMask stores all NFTs owned by the user, and in\nconnection with the NFTrig application, can view and upgrade or modify existing NFTs at a users\ndiscretion. Connection to the browser extension is required for the application to access anything\nowned by a user [24]. Because MetaMask is easily integrated into Moralis, and thus NFTrig, there\nis little a user needs to do to create a connection aside from installing the MetaMask extension, and\nclicking connect. 4.1.4\nFront End Design. Front end design was accomplished primarily through Visual Studio. The\nLive Server extension was installed which allows each developer to \"host\" their developed website\nusing a native web application. Doing so allowed simplified testing and front end development. Instead of creating CSS files from scratch, the NFTrig interface heavily employs Bootstrap5, which\nsimplifies the process of modifying the content layout and design of buttons and other content\n[25]. Moralis and Bootstrap5 each have extensive documentation to understand and support front\nend web development. These tools have been utilized to a near maximum extent. 4.1.5\nWeb Hosting Platform. The initial testing of NFTrig, as previously explained, was hosted on\na local live server through Visual Studio. After initial development, the project was moved to a web\nserver hosted by Augustana College so that initial testing could begin. It is currently unclear how\nthe site will ultimately be hosted. One option for hosting the web application is directly through\nGoogle [32]. This would allow the website to be named something easily searchable and accessible.",

This will have an incredible educational\nbenefit for the user because they will be both learning and playing a game simultaneously.\n2\n\n### MOTIVATION\n\nThe purpose of this application is as an educational tool for students who are attempting to\nunderstand the ways that trigonometric functions interact with each other. As opposed to just\ngraphing these functions by hand, students will be able to generate new NFTs by combining\nwhatever trigonometric functions they already own. In fact, using technology is shown to influence\nand better educational processes by increasing interaction between those in the classroom [9].\nTechnology is becoming increasingly prevalent in every sphere of daily life, so the use of technology\nin a classroom setting is not only logical, but it increases the educational benefit of students [29].\nHowever, as the technology continues to evolve, \"the gap between traditional course material\ntaught to students in B.S./M.S. programs at universities and the cutting edge of technology used in\nindustry is widening at an unprecedented rate\" [30]. By creating this project, it will give students\nthe opportunity to gain experience with block chain, and hopefully be a starting place for narrowing\nthat ever growing gap. After much research, it is likely that this proposed application is the first of\nits kind that utilizes NFTs to teach mathematical concepts.\nAside from user benefit of this application, there is also an intellectual merit in the block chain\nand education fields. Best described by Carmen Holotescu, \"As education becomes more open,\ndiversified, democratised, and decentralised, the block chain technology is taken in consideration\nby researchers, teachers and institutions, to maintain reputation, trust in certification, and proof of\nlearning\" [17]. Further, development of this project continues research on NFT and block chain\ntechnologies. This application can also serve as the boilerplate basis for other NFT-based educational\ntools and resources. Research for this project provides opportunities for training computer science\nstudents on how to use NFTs in general, but more specifically in educational contexts.\nNFTrig was developed by computer science students as a final senior inquiry project at Augustana\nCollege. In conjunction and with funding by the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science,\nthis project employs a variety of software development skills and techniques that further the\nresearch and understanding of the block chain and web development field.\n3",

Using this model,\nthe clients send transactions and requests to a proxy smart contract stored on the block chain\nwhich then makes the appropriate calls to the logic smart contract which is also stored on the block\nchain. This style of architecture is required for this project because the smart contracts must be\nstored on the server-side chain in order to be functional. The use of proxy contracts also allows our\nsmart contracts to be fully upgradeable with any future updates that may need to be implemented. 5.2\nChoice of Programming Language\nThis section examines and explains the benefit of each chosen language employed in NFTrig. Front\nend languages include HTML and CSS and the back end includes Solidity and JavaScript. Each has\nbeen chosen because they were found to be the best option for development. 5.2.1\nSolidity. Solidity is the programming language of choice when it comes to coding smart\ncontracts. Solidity is \"similar to JavaScript and yet has some features of object-oriented languages\nsuch as Java and C++\" [26]. This is a leading language for the development of smart contracts and\nuse on block chain technologies. This project utilizes the solidity library openzeppelin in order to\ncreate a solid foundation for the smart contracts. Hardhat and Node JS are then used for the testing\nand deployment of the smart contracts to the Polygon blockchain. 5.2.2\nJavaScript. In the NFTrig application, JavaScript (JS) is primarily used in the front end\napplication. The primary purpose of this language is generally to create dynamic and interactive\nweb content [15]. For the client, JS was used in the navigation bar to allow for clickable links and\nresizing of the navigation bar in smaller screens. This language was also used to give buttons\nfunctionality ranging from logging in to MetaMask to purchasing NFTrig cards. Further, JS was used\nto test the logic of the front-end combination page until the smart contract was applied. Aside from\naugmenting HTML and CSS application pages, JavaScript is also used in this project to connect the\nback end smart contract with the from end web application. This application was also developed\nusing Next JS and deployed via an application known as vercel. 5.2.3\nHTML and CSS. Web development of the user interface was primarily completed using\nHTML and CSS (Bootstrap5). These languages are equally popular and necessary to develop the\nweb pages [13]. Instead of creating all CSS requirements from scratch, Bootstrap5 was utilized to\nallow for cleaner design across web pages and better alignment of web page elements. Bootstrap5\nalso simplifies the need to explicitly code buttons and other interactive items. 5.3\nSecurity Considerations\nThroughout this project, there have been several security considerations discovered that threatened\nthe safety and use of the application. One such discovered issue was initially, there was no code\nwritten to block a user from looking at another users token. Further, before minting a new NFT\ncard, the smart contracts check to ensure that the card does not already exist, the cards used for\ncombining are owned by the user, and that the newly minted card follows the correct probabilities\nof outcomes shows in 2. These probabilities are coded into the smart contract. 5.4\nSmart Contract Design\nThe smart contract for this project is broken up into two separate contracts. The first of which is\nthe NFTrig logic contract which contains the logic for purchasing packs of cards as well as the logic\nfor how cards will interact with each other. The second contract is the marketplace contract which\nwill allow users to trade their own NFTs with other users through the website.",

The marketplace\ncontract contains information about sale history as well as the functionality to post new sales and\npurchase items for sale. Both of these contracts were deployed as upgradeable contracts so they\ncan have updates implemented in the future. 5.5\nNFT Storage and Naming Conventions\nAll NFT images are stored on the server with the HTML, CSS, and JS files. The naming convention\nfor each image references what image it is in four numbers. The first number is the power of sin, the\nsecond is the power of cos, the third is the rarity or color of the card (0-3 is green, blue, purple, and\nred respectively), and the final number is the text variant (0-3). These files were named accordingly\nto better determine the output if cards were combined using a mathematical function. For example,\na sin card might have the naming convention: 1023.jpg. 10 defines it is a sin card, 2 defines it is\nrarity purple, and 3 defines it is text variant 3. The purpose of naming the files in this way is so\nthat the front end can easily determine which image corresponds to a particular NFT by simply\nlooking at the four features of each token which match the four numbers in the file name. 5.6\nClient Design\nThe NFTrig application interface was designed using HTML and CSS. The primary use of CSS was\noften replaced by Bootstrap5. Bootstrap 5, a library for CSS, allows for easier scaling and alignment\nof objects in the HTML file, and thus the computer screen [23]. Documentation on the Bootstrap5\nhas utilized to a full extent. Each section examines the layout and use of each application page. 5.6.1\nNFTrig Home. The interface is designed to allow a user to access the marketplace, their\nindividual current collections, and their profile. The navigational bar contains links to the client-side\nfacing pages: NFTrigHome, MyCards, CombineCards, Marketplace, and Game. We used a total of\nthree colors to enable good contrast and make it easier for our users to view complex graphs and\nformula without a cluttered background 2. The JavaScript elements declared are reusable across\nmultiple screens. They support functions and interactions such as a user hovering over a cell or\nclicking a cell and providing both feedback and error handling to the user. The navigation bar is\nalso, the top bar changes color to indicate the tab that the user is on. 5.6.2\nCombination. The main purpose of the combination page is for users to choose cards that\nthey currently own, and see options for combining them using either multiplication or division. Figure 1 displays the layout of the screen where user selected cards are shown on the left, and\npotential results are shown on the right. The page utilizes Bootstrap5 capabilities to format effectively to different screen sizes and\nresolutions. It connects with a back end script to the smart contract. This provides functionality to\nthe buttons and easy generation of possible NFT results. Below shows the probabilities of generated\nNFT outcomes based on the selected input cards. 5.6.3\nMarketplace and MyCards. Marketplace and MyCards are similar pages, as they connect to\na data source and display NFTs. The Marketplace tab shows all NFT cards available for purchase\nboth from other users who own NFTs and cards owned by the NFTrig project.

Interface displaying NFTrig Marketplace\nmost application uses, three user cases were devised: a user browsing NFTrigs, a user making a\npurchase, and a user combining NFTrigs. All assumptions and expected actions expected from\nthe system were listed and analyzed through testing. Further, testing through some edge cases\nwere also pursued. Currently, the application works as intended, however future plans involve\nrigorous testing with JavaScript code and external APIs (if any are devised). This will ensure a fully\nfunctional, secure, and usable application that can also be used as a boiler plate project for other\neducational blockchain technologies. 5.6.6\nFuture Work: Game. Future work for this project will include the ability for users to play\na trivia and trigonometric equation game. This allows a user to gain experience points that they\ncan then use to purchase new NFTs. This eliminates the need to always need cryptocurrency to\npurchase individual or group NFT cards. Although there is not currently an interface for this page\nwritten in HTML, functionality exists for the trivia game itself.

After much research, it is likely that this proposed application is the first of\nits kind that utilizes NFTs to teach mathematical concepts.\nAside from user benefit of this application, there is also an intellectual merit in the block chain\nand education fields. Best described by Carmen Holotescu, \"As education becomes more open,\ndiversified, democratised, and decentralised, the block chain technology is taken in consideration\nby researchers, teachers and institutions, to maintain reputation, trust in certification, and proof of\nlearning\" [17]. Further, development of this project continues research on NFT and block chain\ntechnologies. This application can also serve as the boilerplate basis for other NFT-based educational\ntools and resources. Research for this project provides opportunities for training computer science\nstudents on how to use NFTs in general, but more specifically in educational contexts.\nNFTrig was developed by computer science students as a final senior inquiry project at Augustana\nCollege.

This\nallowed initial testing and validation that the smart contract operated as expected, as well as give\ntime and opportunity to discover security vulnerabilities. The future of this project will be hosted\non a decentralized web application online so that users can access it and begin to interact with the\nsmart contract. Further, a redesign of the website user interface is likely. This will require transition\nfrom BootStrap5 to NextJS which allows cards to be generated, displayed, and interactable through\na version of JavaScript.\n7\n\n## RESULTS\n\nThis project successfully allowed the exploration and creation of applying NFT and block chain\ntechnology to math education. Although preliminary in use and nature, this project allows for\ninitial project creation as a boiler plate project. The smart contract is currently deployed on the\n10\nJordan Thompson, Ryan Benac, Kidus Olana, Talha Hassan, Andrew Sward, and Tauheed Khan Mohd\nPolygon testnet and can be interacted with using test Matic. Each web page has functionality to\ndisplay the user’s owned NFTs as well as the NFTs they have put for sale on the marketplace. Using\nNextJS will also allow the Combination page to have functionality and smart contract use. It is also\nworth noting that the created web page is not required to interact with the NFTrig smart contracts.\n8\n\n### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE WORK\n\nThe goal for this project was a working Beta demo that shows application functionality, and correct\nsmart contract execution. There are many other features planned for the continued work of this\nproject. The first, as earlier explained, is a game option which challenges the user with trigonometry\ntrivia and math problems. Answering these questions successfully will increase the experience\npoints of a user. The user can then use these experience points to purchase individual or packs of\nNFTrig cards, or they can be used to combine cards.",
