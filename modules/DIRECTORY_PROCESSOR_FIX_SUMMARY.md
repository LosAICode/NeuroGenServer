# Directory Processing Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis
The "No file selected" error was occurring because:
1. The system is designed to process **directories**, not individual files
2. The form expects an `input_dir` parameter (directory path) but the code was looking for individual file selection
3. The `handleFileSubmit` method was trying to process individual files instead of directories

## How the System Should Work
1. User enters a directory path in the "Input Directory" field OR
2. User clicks "Browse" button to select a directory using the folder picker
3. User enters an output filename (without .json extension)
4. User clicks "Start Processing"
5. System processes ALL files in the selected directory and creates a single JSON output

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated handleFileSubmit Method
- Changed from looking for individual files to getting directory path from form
- Now properly reads `input_dir` and `output_file` from form data
- Validates that both fields are filled before processing

### 2. Created processDirectory Method
- New method specifically for directory processing
- Sends proper JSON request to `/api/process` endpoint
- Includes required `input_dir` and `output_file` parameters

### 3. Enhanced handleFileSelection Method
- When user selects a folder using the browse button
- Extracts directory name from webkitRelativePath
- Updates the input-dir field automatically
- Shows directory info including file count

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Manual Entry**: User can type/paste a directory path directly into "Input Directory" field
2. **Browse Selection**: 
   - Click Browse button → Select a folder → Directory name appears in input field
   - Shows info about selected directory and file count
3. **Form Submission**: 
   - Validates both input directory and output filename are provided
   - Sends proper request to backend with directory path
   - No more "No file selected" errors

## Testing Instructions

1. **Refresh the page** to load the updated code
2. **Method 1 - Manual Entry**:
   - Type a valid directory path in "Input Directory" field (e.g., `/home/user/documents`)
   - Enter output filename (e.g., `processed_data`)
   - Click "Start Processing"

3. **Method 2 - Browse Selection**:
   - Click the "Browse" button
   - Select a folder from the picker
   - Directory name will auto-populate in the input field
   - Enter output filename
   - Click "Start Processing"

## Important Notes

- The `webkitdirectory` attribute is **correct** and should remain - it enables directory selection
- Web browsers have security limitations:
  - Can only get directory name, not full absolute path when using browse button
  - For full path processing, users need to manually enter the complete path
- The backend expects absolute paths for processing

## Backend Expectations

The `/api/process` endpoint expects:
```json
{
  "input_dir": "/absolute/path/to/directory",
  "output_file": "output_filename_without_extension"
}
```

## Limitations

Due to browser security:
- Browse button can only provide directory name, not full path
- For server-side processing of local directories, users must provide full absolute paths
- Consider adding path validation or server-side directory browsing for better UX
